<p>This project was such a fun project to work on! It was so cool to see this story
from a new perspective. But a lot of this wasn't my own original ideas. I owe a
lot of this to Brother Belnap, my professor for <em>Pearl of Great Price</em>. As we
explored these concepts in class, he brought up so many amazing points, so many
interesting pieces of doctrine, that really helped to put everything in a new
light. There was so much about the creation story that I wasn't even able to
include in this exploration that just blew my mind. So thanks to Brother Belnap
for all of the effort that he put into collecting all of this together and
presenting it in a clear, easy-to-understand way.</p>
