# Introduction

The Book of Moses. An inspired translation of the beginning chapters of the Book
of Genesis done by the prophet Joseph Smith. A book that contains many restored
truths that are not found in the book from which it was translated.

Many Latter-Day Saints consider the Book of Moses to be simply an enhanced
version of the Book of Genesis, a version with more details. While it is
possible that this is the case, it is also possible, maybe even probable, that
the two books in fact came from two similar but distinct source materials.

The Book of Genesis contains a recounting of the history of the world from the
creation of the world to the creation of the nation of Israel. It takes a
third-person perspective in order to demonstrate how God has performed his acts
of creation.

The Book of Moses, on the other hand, seems to have a different focus. In the
first chapter, God begins by teaching Moses some important truths about the
nature of God's glory, the nature of being a Son of God, and the nature of
Moses' work. From the beginning, God wants to make the experience one that is
not just informative, but that incites learning and spiritual growth. This is an
opportunity for Moses to discover what his calling as a prophet truly means.

Thus, as we dive into the creation narrative, let's consider it from Moses'
perspective. Why is God telling him these things? What does God want Moses to
understand from them? What truths, what principles can Moses find in these
stories?

Well, join me and let's find out.
